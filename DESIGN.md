# hettyversion


## Core Features

* A headyversion.com clone with support for arbitrary song lists and multiple bands
* A head-to-head song ranking game (e.g. http://www.allourideas.org/)

## Tech Stack

* Python (what version?)
* Flask

## Schema Design

> [2:40]  
> looks like we have Users (with profile fields), Songs (with meta data), Versions (with votes)

## Questions

* How do we handle different versions of songs? can people just add new versions at will?
